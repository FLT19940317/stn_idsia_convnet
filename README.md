# Spatial Transformer Networks with IDSIA-like classifier for German Traffic Signs Dataset classification

This repository introduces a TensorFlow-based implementation of STN + IDSIA classifier that is applied to [GTSRB (German Traffic Signs Recognition Benchmark)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/) dataset.

This repository provides the source code and the context for my blog post on Medium:
